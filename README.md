# Brunel-University-CS2004-Algorithms-and-their-Applications

Shoutout to the GTA which shouted at me during the coderunner saying the problem was my code when he didn't bother to check my code and simply said "THE PROBLEM IS YOUR CODE." When in fact it was some background information which I didn't know about coderunner.

Some labs I did while at university.

Includes things such as solving the Travelling sales person using a number of algorithms (RRHC, RMHC etc)

These files will  probably be useful for those currently studying at brunel university currently, or those which have an interest in algorithms performance.
