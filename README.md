# Brunel-University-CS2004-Algorithms-and-their-Applications

Some labs I did while at university.

Includes things such as solving the Travelling sales person using a number of algorithms (RRHC, RMHC etc)

These files will  probably be useful for those currently studying at brunel university currently, or those which have an interest in algorithms performance.
